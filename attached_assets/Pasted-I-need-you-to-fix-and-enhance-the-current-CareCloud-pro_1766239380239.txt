I need you to fix and enhance the current CareCloud prototype with the following requirements:

1. **404 Hosting Issue**
   - The GitHub Pages version is showing “404 Not Found”.
   - Instead of GitHub Pages, host the frontend on Replit with a proper static or Node.js server that serves `index.html`, `dashboard_child.html`, and `dashboard_parent.html` correctly.
   - Ensure all routes and assets load correctly (no 404s).

2. **Email Alert System**
   - The current email alert for parents is not working.
   - Implement a working email alert system:
     - Use a free email provider like **SendGrid** (preferred) or **Gmail API**.
     - When a child’s message is flagged for toxicity, automatically email the parent.
     - The email should include:
       - **Report title**
       - **Label(s) detected** (toxicity, hate, threats, etc.)
       - **Reason why the alert was triggered**
       - **Supportive recommendations**
   - The backend (Node.js/Express) or Replit server should securely store API keys (e.g., in `.env`) and send the email via SendGrid.

3. **Labels with Analysis Result**
   - After a message is analyzed by Gemini AI (flash model), display:
     - **Toxicity score**
     - **Detected categories (labels)** like “Hate Speech”, “Insult”, “Threat”
     - A clear explanation of what those labels mean
     - Approachable supportive language on the UI

4. **Fill Empty Space on UI**
   - The “Check Content” area currently has a blank space.
   - Add appropriate supportive text such as:
     - **Positive Suggestions**
     - **Helpful Tips for Emotional Well-Being**
     - **Encouraging statements about online safety**

5. **Parent and Child Dashboards**
   - Child dashboard:
     - Soft/pastel UI for kids
     - Pleasant fonts and icons
     - Show analysis history and positive suggestions
   - Parent dashboard:
     - Show a list of alerts
     - Each alert should show:
       - Date/time
       - Child account name
       - Labels detected
       - Brief explanation
       - Link to full report
     - Provide high-level guidance for parents (e.g., how to talk to their child, online safety tips)

6. **Judges-Friendly Enhancements**
   - Add a **report export/download option** (PDF or email summary)
   - Add **search/filter** for parents to filter alerts by label or date
   - Add a **“Learn More” section** with tips on cyberbullying, prevention strategies, and emotional support resources
   - Add animation or subtle transitions for better UX

7. **Replit Setup**
   - Ensure a working `server.js` or Express backend for endpoints:
     - `/analyze`
     - `/sendAlert`
     - `/login`
     - `/dashboard_child`
     - `/dashboard_parent`
   - Properly load static files
   - Use `.env` for sensitive keys

Output the **full updated code** — including `server.js`, HTML files, CSS, frontend JS, SendGrid integration, and deployment instructions — so that the prototype works end-to-end.

Bonus: include a `README.md` with setup and judge demo steps.
