I am building an AI-powered cyberbullying prevention app called **CareCloud** (Child–Parent safety system).
There are a few critical issues and UI gaps that must be fixed and improved to make the prototype judge-ready.

Please do the following fixes and enhancements carefully:

-----------------------------------
1️⃣ FIX EMAIL ALERT SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
-----------------------------------
Problem:
- Alert emails are NOT being sent to the parent email.
- Parent is not receiving any report even when high toxicity is detected.

Fix:
- Ensure the email is actually sent using a working email service (Gmail API / SendGrid / Nodemailer).
- Email must be sent to the **parent_email linked to the child account**.
- Trigger email ONLY when toxicity severity crosses a defined threshold.

Email content MUST include:
- Child name / ID (do NOT include raw abusive content)
- Clear LABELS of exposure (e.g. Harassment, Hate Speech, Threats, Sexual Content, Self-Harm)
- Short explanation of WHY help is required
- Severity level (Low / Medium / High)
- Recommended parent action (support, conversation, monitoring, counseling)

Example email structure:
Subject: 🚨 CareCloud Alert – Attention Required

Body:
- Detected Issue Labels
- Severity Level
- Why this is concerning
- How parents can help
- Reassuring, calm, non-panic tone

-----------------------------------
2️⃣ ADD CLEAR LABELS TO ANALYSIS RESULT
-----------------------------------
Problem:
- Analysis results are unclear and lack labeled explanation.

Fix:
- Add visible labeled chips/tags under the analysis result:
  - Toxicity
  - Harassment
  - Hate Speech
  - Threats
  - Sexual Content
  - Emotional Abuse
- Each label should show:
  - Detected / Not Detected
  - Color coded (green, yellow, red)

-----------------------------------
3️⃣ FIX EMPTY SPACE BELOW "CHECK CONTENT"
-----------------------------------
Problem:
- There is empty unused space under the "Check Content" section.

Fix:
Fill this space with meaningful content such as:
- Positive coping tips for the child
- Affirmation messages
- Educational tips like:
  “You are not alone.”
  “It’s okay to ask for help.”
  “Mean messages do not define your worth.”

This section should ALWAYS be visible.

-----------------------------------
4️⃣ CHILD DASHBOARD UX IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------
- Keep the UI soft, pastel, and kid-friendly.
- Use rounded cards, friendly fonts, emojis where appropriate.
- Ensure "Quick Tips / Positive Suggestions" NEVER disappear after analysis.
- Results should appear beside or below tips, not replace them.

-----------------------------------
5️⃣ PARENT DASHBOARD IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------
- Show alert history with:
  - Date
  - Labels
  - Severity
- NO raw abusive text (privacy protection).
- Add a “How to Respond” guidance section for parents.

-----------------------------------
6️⃣ MAKE PROTOTYPE JUDGE-IMPRESSIVE
-----------------------------------
Add these enhancements:
- Severity meter (progress bar or emoji scale)
- Friendly loading animation while AI analyzes
- Clear explanation: “AI is used to protect, not punish”
- Accessibility: large buttons, readable text
- Add a short “Why CareCloud?” section

-----------------------------------
7️⃣ CODE QUALITY
-----------------------------------
- Clean, commented, readable code
- Separate UI, logic, and services
- Ensure everything runs correctly on Replit
- Use ONLY free or free-tier services

-----------------------------------
Final Output Required:
- Fixed working email alert system
- Improved UI with labels and filled sections
- Clear comments explaining changes
- Ready-to-demo prototype

This project is intended for judges evaluating social impact, AI responsibility, and user safety.
Please prioritize clarity, emotional safety, and polish.
